                <h3>Param Vir Chakra action</h3>
                <p>In early July, 'B' Company of 1/11 GR was assigned the task to capture Khalubar top. Pandey was commanding a Platoon in this company.Quickly sizing up the situation, he killed two enemy personnel and destroyed the second position by killing
                    two more. Although wounded in the shoulder and leg, he pressed on his solitary charge with serious determination, until he closed in on the first bunker. The two armies engaged in a ferocious, hand-to-hand combat. The troops charged
                    at the enemy and fell upon them. Undaunted and without caring for his grievous injuries, he continued to lead the assault on the fourth position urging his men and destroyed the same with a grenade, even as he got a fatal burst on
                    his forehead. He collapsed at the final bunker and succumbed to his injuries</p>
